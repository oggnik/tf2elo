# tf2elo

This project calculates Elo scores for teams participating in the ESEA Invite TF2 league.  After calculating the scores based on previous matches the rest of the season is simulated.  The amount of times each team reaches the playoffs is recorded and used to give the chance of making playoffs for each team.
